# IMC Prosperity 2

This repository contains the IMC Prosperity 2 code from my solo team "Noobland" (named humorously as a nod to my next to no prior experience with coding and trading).

Final position: 265th overall, 10th in Singapore.

Huge shoutout to the GOAT [jmerle](https://github.com/jmerle), who developed the open-sourced [visualizer](https://github.com/jmerle/imc-prosperity-2-visualizer) and [backtester](https://github.com/jmerle/imc-prosperity-2-backtester). These tools were invaluable in helping me grasp how the simulated markets moved.

## Products

### Amethysts
I assumed a true value of 10,000 seashells, and utilised market-making and market-taking strategies concurrently. The strategy dynamically adjusts order sizes and prices based on market conditions and my current position.

### Starfruit
I used a simple linear regression model to predict the next mid-price of the STARFRUIT product based on the last 10 mid-prices. The strategy compares the predicted price to the current best bid and ask prices to generate buy or sell signals, considering spread conditions and position limits.
