# IMC Prosperity 2

This repository contains the IMC Prosperity 2 code from my solo team "Noobland" (named humorously as a nod to my next to no prior experience with coding and trading).

Final position: 265th overall, 10th in Singapore.

Huge shoutout to the GOAT [jmerle](https://github.com/jmerle), who developed the open-sourced [visualizer](https://github.com/jmerle/imc-prosperity-2-visualizer) and [backtester](https://github.com/jmerle/imc-prosperity-2-backtester). These tools were invaluable in helping me grasp how the simulated markets moved.

## About

IMC Prosperity 2024 was a global algorithmic trading competition that spanned 15 days and saw participation from over 9,000 teams. The challenge involved algorithmically trading a variety of products, including amethysts, starfruit, orchids, and coconuts, with the goal of accumulating seashells, the currency of our island. We began by trading amethysts and starfruit in the first round, with new products introduced in each subsequent round. After each round, our trading algorithm was evaluated against automated bot participants in the marketplace, whose actions we tried to predict using historical data. The resulting profit and loss (PNL) from this evaluation were compared with the performance of other teams.

In addition to the primary focus on algorithmic trading, the competition also featured manual trading challenges in each round. These challenges varied in focus, but manual trading ultimately contributed a small portion of our total PNL.
